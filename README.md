# Lorenz Attractor

An animated, 3D, interactive Lorenz attractor written in C with OpenGL.

This is an experiment I did a while back, figured I would open source it.

## Building (OSX), Windows, Ubuntu. 

1. Run `make`
2. Run `./lorenz`

This `lorenz` binary has been prebuilt on Ubuntu 14.4.

## Using

You can interact with the attractor using the following key bindings:

- q: Rotate X axis +
- a: Rotate X axis -
- w: Rotate Y axis +
- s: Rotate Y axis -
- e: Rotate Z axis +
- d: Rotate Z axis -
- r: Restart animation
- f: Finish animation
- t: Animation speed +
- g: Animation speed -
- y: Zoom Z axis +
- h: Zoom Z axis -
- UP: Rotate X axis +
- DOWN: Rotate X axis -
- LEFT: Rotate Y axis +
- RIGHT: Rotate Y axis -

## Background

This program follows a trace of the Lorenz attractor points calculated within the program using the following equations:
- dx/dt = (Prandtl)(y-x)
- dy/dt = x((Rayleigh)-z)-y
- dz/dt = xy - (beta)

By default, the program has the following values:

- Prandtl = 10
- Rayleigh = 2.6666 or 8/3
- beta = 28
